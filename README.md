IMAGE CAPTIONING
Combine computer vision and natural language processing to build
an image captioning AI. we Use pre-trained image recognition models
like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use a
recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to
generate captions for those images.
